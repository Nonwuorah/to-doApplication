                                                To-Do Application with Redux State Mangement


we are going to use what we have learned previously to create a ToDo Application while using Redux to manage the global state.

                      //Instructions
Create  the following component:
- Addtask
- ListTask
- Task

Every task should have the following attributes:
- Id
- Description
- isDone

The user should be:
- Able to add a newTodo
- Filter the tasks by (done/not)
- Edit a task
